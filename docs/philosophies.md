## Build a Sustainable Business

Aim to build a sustainable (read: profitable) business from day one. This does not mean that we will *always* turn a profit or that we will *never* raise funding, but it means that one of the primary decision-making factors is whether or not that decision impacts our ability to sustainably exist.

We do not exist solely to raise as much venture capital as possible nor to chase 'unicorn' status. We exist to provide a valuable product to our customers and to profit from that in exchange so that we can form a sustainable business.
