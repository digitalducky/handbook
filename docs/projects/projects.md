### What are Secret Projects?

Secret projects are in active development but are not public.
Secret projects use duck codenames.
These are not final product names.
Secret projects may become public projects - but they should be renamed at that time.

Need to name a new secret project?
Maybe start with the [Wikipedia page on ducks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck).
